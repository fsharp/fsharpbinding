F# Language Binding for MonoDevelop
Released under the Apache 2.0 License

Now works on Ubuntu with Monodevelop 2.8.2 from this PPA:

  http://ppa.launchpad.net/keks9n/monodevelop-latest/ubuntu/

Requires a custom install of F# for Mono 4.0 per items 1 and 2 of
these instructions:

  https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding/issues/24#issuecomment-3786164

Code completion works. Building works even though the first time after
a clean produces an error message "Could not find support file
.../FSharp.Core.dll", which does not occur on subsequent runs or
builds.
