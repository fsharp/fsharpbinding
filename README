F# Language Binding for MonoDevelop
Released under the Apache 2.0 License

Now works on Ubuntu with Monodevelop 2.8.2 from this PPA:

  http://ppa.launchpad.net/keks9n/monodevelop-latest/ubuntu/

Requires a custom install of F# for Mono 4.0 per items 1 and 2 of
these instructions:

  https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding/issues/24#issuecomment-3786164

After building and installing this add-in, a symbolic link is required
to eliminate the spurious error message "Could not find support file
.../FSharp.Core.dll".

  sudo ln -s /usr/lib/mono/4.0/FSharp.Core.dll /opt/monodevelop/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/BackendBindings/

Code completion works. Sending code to F# Interactive does not work
because extraneous metadata gets sent in addition to the code
