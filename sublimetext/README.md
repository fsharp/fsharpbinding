## FSharp - F# Support for Sublime Text

This package provides support for F# development in Sublime Text.

FSharp is currently a preview and not ready for use. If you want to
contribute to its development, you can read on to learn how to set up a
development environment.


### Developing FSharp

Pull requests to FSharp are welcome.

At the moment, FSharp is only compatible with Sublime Text 3 on Windows.

See also *FSharp_Tests/README.md*.

General steps:

* Clone this repository to any folder outside of Sublime Text's *Data* folder
* Edit files as needed
* Edit tests in FSharp_Tests as needed
* Publish the project using the provided scripts
* Restart Sublime Text
* Run the tests

There are scripts to build *FSharp.sublime-package* automatically on Linux,
OS X and Windows, but they may not work on your computer at present.

The file *manifest.json* should contain all the files that need to be
included in *FSharp.sublime-package*.

### Windows development environment

#### Requirements

* Python 2.7 or above, or Python 3.3 or above.

If you're using a portable installation of Sublime Text, you must set
`$STDataPath` in your PowerShell session to Sublime Text's *Data* path. For
full installations, the script will attempt to find said directory
automatically.

Run `.\bin\GetDependencies.ps1` once to get dependencies.
Run `.\bin\Publish.ps1` to publish locally any changes to the files.
